The engine is split up into several modules.

A summary of how the engine works:
The engine is a collection of modules that encapsulate code that provides needed functionality for the worldsim and game cores.
The modules are written in such a way that the worldsim and game cores, and even other engine modules, do not care how the features are implemented, only that they are.
Do not be mislead. Many times the modules are only wrapping the c++ standard library or other handy libraries.

Module List:
Graphics,
Networking,
Math,
String,
Audio,
Control,
Interface,
Config,
Error,
Thread,
Data,
File

See each module subdirectory for an explanation of what each module does.

Namespace:
All engine code used to be in the engine namespace. But, engine::modulename_module::modulesusbsystem is a pain to type. So, no namespace.
Here's the module naming convention:
m<modulename>

Looking through the modules' namespaces though...I think a naming convention needs to be agreed upon, since typing
engine::graphics_module::window_manager_subsystem
can be quite a pain.
