Purpose:
Window management.

Functionality Requirements:
1. Multiple windows.
2. The resizing of a window.
3. Fullscreen support.
4. Going from fullscreen to windowed mode and vice versa at runtime.
5. Support common bit depths.
6. Support a wide range of resolutions, if not infinite (by infinite, I mean, whatever is the max the computer running this supports. Like some computers can't go past 800x600, while mine can go way over 1600x900).

Libraries/engines used (dependencies):
SFML and OpenGL.

Namespace:
None is needed due to encapsulation provided by OO programming. So, it's part of the graphic module's namespace.
