Purpose:
Handle all 2D graphics code, including, but not limited to: Textures, loading and creation of images, rendering of text, etc.

Libraries/engines used (dependencies):
SFML and OpenGL.

Required Functionality:
	1. Load images and textures.
	2. Automatically free images and textures on program exit.
	3. Rendering of text into an image such that it can be drawn onto the screen.
	4. Working with the 3D code such as to be able to draw 2D images to the screen even when in 3D mode (such as interface elements, text, etc).

Libraries/engines used (dependencies):
SFML and OpenGL.

Namespace:
None is needed due to encapsulation provided by OO programming. So, it's part of the graphic module's namespace. -- WRONG. There will probably be conflicts since everything cannot be plopped into one big class.
So: All of the 2D module is contained within namespace d2d.

Module Dependencies:
