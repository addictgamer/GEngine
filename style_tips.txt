1. Include files in the most logical order
   
   #include <std_header_1>
   ...
   
   #include <3rd_party_header_1>
   ...
   
   #include "local_header_1"
   ...
   
   This way, overrides and redefines come in a logical order. For example, you
   probably want your defines and undefines to take priority over those of the
   standard library or something like Boost.
   
2. Include SFML libraries as late as possible
   
   Since SFML includes "windows.h", using it with Boost::Asio means you need to
   include Asio before SFML. This is because Winsock cannot be included after
   windows.h, only before.
